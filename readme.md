# Stickies-Box

## Project Description

- Send, receive and store your stickies safely from any physical damage! 

### Purpose of this app

- I have letters and stickies which I have accumulated since elementary school. I totally forgot about the existence of them.

  but then one day, it appeared to be eaten by my rabbit, Tobby (Sadly, he does not exist anymore) but he was indeed cool rabbit.

  Anyway, the purpose of this app is to have safe stickies and letter storage protected from any rabbit bites.
