# Stickies Box

## Project Description

- Send, receive and store your stickies safely from any physical damage!

### Purpose of this app

- I have letters and stickies which I have accumulated since elementary school. I totally forgot about the existence of them.

  but then one day, it appeared to be eaten by my rabbit, Tobby (Sadly, he does not exist anymore) but he was indeed a cool rabbit.

  Anyway, the purpose of this app is to have safe stickies and letter storage protected from any rabbit's bites.
